1. How do I approach designing software?
   - When I started this project, I realized the easiest way to design something big is to break it into smaller, simple parts. Instead of trying to build the whole desk scene at once, I focused on one object at a time. I thought about which basic shapes would fit best and how they could come together. For example, the lamp needed more planning since it had different pieces, but by sketching it out first I knew exactly what shapes to use. That kind of step-by-step thinking made the process less overwhelming and helped me stay organized.
  
2. How do I approach developing programs?
   - As I worked through the milestones, I found that building programs is all about trial, error, and improvement. At first, my main goal was just to get objects to appear, but as I kept testing I started paying more attention to details like how big they were or where they were placed. Each small fix taught me something, and by the end, I had a better rhythm of testing, adjusting, and refining. Development became less about rushing to finish and more about slowly shaping the project until it felt right.
  
3. How can computer science help me in reaching my goals?
   - This project showed me how computer science ties into real goals by blending problem-solving with creativity. Modeling shapes with code taught me to think visually while still relying on logic and math. That combination made me see how the same approach can be used outside graphics, whether it is for school projects or future work. Knowing how to take an abstract idea and turn it into something structured and functional is a skill I can use in any area of programming.
